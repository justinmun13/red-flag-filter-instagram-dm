**Winner Submission for Gala Labs Instagram Buildathon 🏆**

*Protecting dating app users from digital predators with AI-powered analysis*

Red Flag Filter is an AI-powered system that automatically analyzes Instagram DMs to detect dangerous patterns in dating conversations. It protects users from manipulation, financial scams, and emotional abuse by providing real-time risk assessment and smart safety recommendations.

## 🎯 **Live Account Testing - Analyze YOUR Real Instagram DMs**

Unlike demo tools, Red Flag Filter analyzes your **actual Instagram conversations** to detect real threats in your DMs:

- **🔍 Real-Time DM Analysis**: Connects to your Instagram account via MCP integration
- **📱 Live Account Scanning**: Analyzes your actual conversations for red flags  
- **🛡️ Privacy-First**: Only analyzes messages sent TO you (not your messages)
- **⚡ Instant Results**: See real threats in your actual Instagram DMs
- **📊 Personal Dashboard**: View your account's safety analysis with real data

## 🚨 Risk Assessment Matrix

| Risk Level | Detection Focus | Example Threats |
|---|---|---|
| 🚨 **CRITICAL** | Financial scams, threats | "Send me $500 for emergency" |
| ⚠️ **HIGH** | Manipulation, personal info requests | "What's your address? Give me your number" |
| ⚡ **MEDIUM** | Love bombing, guilt tripping | "You're perfect! We're soulmates!" |
| ✅ **LOW** | Normal conversation | "Hi! How's your day going?" |
